# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I’m a Computer Science student with a passion for building real-world solutions — especially in dynamic cities like Karachi.  

🔍 I'm currently focused on landing a meaningful tech internship by refining my resume, polishing my GitHub and LinkedIn, reaching out to professionals, and mapping out top software/tech companies in Karachi. It’s all part of leveling up my learning, networking, and future-readiness.  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on hands-on projects or roles — especially in **project or product management** — where I can contribute meaningfully and grow through real-world exposure.  

🎯 Right now, I’m working on staying disciplined and focused as I prepare for my final year at university, aiming to become a stronger learner, teammate, and future-ready computer scientist.  

💬 **Ask me about**: life at IBA, calisthenics, popular anime, games I’ve played (or coded), or what it's really like hustling in Karachi’s tech scene.  

🎉 **Fun fact**: You’re more likely to get into a fender bender in Karachi traffic than name a sport I haven’t played or don’t know well. From cricket and calisthenics to boxing and basketball — I’ve probably already been in the game! 🏏🥋⚽🏀🚦
