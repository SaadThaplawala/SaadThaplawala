# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I’m a Computer Science student driven by a mission to build real-world tech solutions — especially for fast-paced, chaotic cities like Karachi.  

🔍 I’m actively refining my resume, polishing my GitHub and LinkedIn, and mapping out top tech companies in Karachi — all while hunting for a great internship that challenges and grows me.  

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on hands-on projects, especially in **project or product management** roles where I can learn, lead, and contribute meaningfully.

🎯 As I prep for my final year at university, I’m focused on staying disciplined, sharpening my skills, and shaping my path as a future-ready computer scientist.

💬 **Ask me about:** life at IBA, calisthenics workouts, anime like *Attack on Titan*, games I’ve played (or coded), or the hustle of Karachi’s tech scene.

🎉 **Fun fact:** You're more likely to get into a fender bender in Karachi traffic than name a sport I haven’t played or don’t know well. From cricket and calisthenics to boxing and basketball — I’ve probably already been in the game! 🏏🥋⚽🏀🚦
